      <h2>This is awesome</h2>
        <p>This is supposed to be a nice little paragraph for my test site.  I originally made a proper page but to show off what I have learned I wanted to type this random stuff.</p>
      <h3>Hello again</h3>
        <p>Heres another paragraph meant to show my learning of how to make a list so here is a random list</p>
            <ul>
                <li>Blue</li>
                <li>Three</li>
                <li>Cell Phone</li>
            </ul>
      <p>This was meant to show a link so <a href="https://www.bhphotovideo.com/c/product/1238275-REG/canon_1159c008_eos_rebel_t6_dslr.html">Here</a> is a link to a camera similar to mine</p>
